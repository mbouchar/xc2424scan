This is a simple Python GUI that can be used to download scanned files from a Xerox WorkCenter C2424 scanner.

The files are stocked in the internal disk of the scanner and a simple network protocol can be used to download the files.
The protocol is described in the [doc/protocol.md](doc/protocol.md) file.
